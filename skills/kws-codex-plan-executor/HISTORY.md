# History

## 2.19.0 - 2026-05-19

- Moved execution code worktrees to `~/.codex/worktrees/<plan-slug>-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`.
- Moved orchestration state and runtime artifacts to
  `~/.codex/orchestrator/<plan-slug>-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`.
- Changed subagents to default on; `subagents=off` now selects local-only
  execution.
- Removed retired local replay and learning helpers from the active contract.
- Tightened deterministic evals around path separation and legacy rejection.
